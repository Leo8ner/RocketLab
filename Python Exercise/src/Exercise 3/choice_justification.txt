The selected controller is an optimal controller. 
In most cases it performes better than a PID constroller as it optimizes the trajectory as a whole.
It is more complex and slower, however, this is not a problem when the goal is just to generate a reference trajectory for guidance.
To convert this into a real-time controller, the horizon whould have to be fixed and reduced, and then the controller would be called at a fixed rate
updating the state in a closed loop -> AKA an MPC.

The selected weights for each of the components of the cost function are:
# Cost function weights
W_x               = 1                  # Weight for horizontal position---------, -
W_z               = 1                  # Weight for vertical position-----------, -
W_theta           = 1                  # Weight for pitch angle-----------------, -
W_vx              = 1                  # Weight for horizontal velocity---------, -
W_vz              = 1                  # Weight for vertical velocity-----------, -
W_wy              = 1                  # Weight for angular velocity------------, -
W_T               = 1                  # Weight for engine thrust---------------, -
W_gim             = 1                  # Weight for gimbal angle----------------, -
W_T_rate          = 1                  # Weight for engine throttle rate--------, -
W_gim_rate        = 1                  # Weight for gimbal rate-----------------, -
W_H               = 10                 # Weight for time horizon----------------, -

The reasoning behind them is just that we want every state to be reduced to 0, with no specific priority.
If the used propellant mass was a state it would be the priority. The altitude and vertically velocity are already constrained
to 0 at the final state, so their weights are irrelevant.

The trust and gimbal rate weights are just there to guide the solver to a smoother trajectory, reduce actuator strain and reduce failure rates.

The time horizon weight is the most relevant as it ensures the solver converges within the time limit.
Additionally, the faster you land, the least propellant you consume, so minimizing landing time and minimizing
consumed propellant are almost analogous.
